## How do These Make Sense in Context?
> In the context of a CYOA story, these relationships make sense, as it grants the player the option to travel down different paths, but ultimately there is one objectively better path that can be followed, like in most stories. The way the relationships are set up for questions allow for the making of unique decisions, and the context bubbles allow the player to make a decision based on more than just their basic wits.
